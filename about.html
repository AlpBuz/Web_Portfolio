        <p class="about-description">
            Hi, I’m Alp Buz, a fourth-year student at the University at Buffalo, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
            Upon graduation, I plan to continue my studies and obtain a Master’s degree as well. I am currently seeking internship opportunities 
            to kick-start my career in software engineering or web development. I have a solid foundation in several programming languages and technologies, including 
            Python, React, HTML, MySQL, JavaScript, and PHP. Throughout my academic career, I have created numerous projects using these skills. 
            These projects have been instrumental in developing my technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities. For more information about 
            my projects, please visit the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable work 
            experience at Stop & Shop, where I worked as a cashier and produce clerk. I also have hands-on experience working in my family's mechanic                 shop alongside my father, which has equipped me with practical skills and a strong work ethic. Beyond work and studies, I have been playing 
            the guitar since I was 10 years old, which remains a cherished hobby of mine. If you’d like to connect to offer an internship position or 
            to learn more about me, feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out to me</a> or visit my 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alp-buz-2913042b0/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile.
