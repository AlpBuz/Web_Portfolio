                        This was a semester long project that I created with four other members in the class. We created a web app POS system 
                        that a resturant can use. This POS system has features such as:
                    </p>

                        <li>Login and Sign up of users and a manager</li>

                        This web portfolio was created from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences. 
                        It is designed to provide a detailed insight into my work as a developer, featuring a sleek and modern design.
                        The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive and engaging platform where potential clients 
                        and employers can explore my portfolio. I aimed to highlight my technical expertise, creativity, and ability to 
                        build user-friendly websites.

                        Revitalizing an old project, I focused on improving user interaction using what I learned with the POS system project. 
                        This version of the Color Game involves a quick reflex test where players must type the name of the color 
                        they see on the screen, not the color the word spells out. For instance, if the word “red” is colored blue, 
                        the correct answer is “blue”, not “red”.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Starting Page: A welcoming and intuitive landing page that sets the stage for the game.</li>
                        <li>Gameplay: An interface where users type the correct color under a time constraint</li>
                        <li>Leaderboard: For users to compete with friends to get the highest score</li>
