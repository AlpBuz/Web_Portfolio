                A fourth-year student at the University at Buffalo, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
                Upon graduation, I plan to continue my studies and obtain a Master’s degree as well. I am currently seeking internship opportunities 
                to kick-start my career in software engineering or web development. I have a solid foundation in several programming languages and technologies, including 
                Python, React, HTML, MySQL, JavaScript, and PHP. Throughout my academic career, I have created numerous projects using these skills. 
                These projects have been instrumental in developing my technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities. For more information about 
                my projects, please visit the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable work 
                experience at Stop & Shop, where I worked as a cashier and produce clerk. I also have hands-on experience working in my family's mechanic 
                shop alongside my father, which has equipped me with practical skills and a strong work ethic. Beyond work and studies, I have been playing 
                the guitar since I was 10 years old, which remains a cherished hobby of mine. If you’d like to connect to offer an internship position or 
                to learn more about me, feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out to me</a> or visit my

                    This version of the Color Game involves a quick reflex test where players must type the name of the color 
                    they see on the screen, not the color the word spells out. For instance, if the word “red” is colored blue, 
                    the correct answer is “blue”, not “red”.
